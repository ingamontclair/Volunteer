                    including weather derivatives (weather futures), which is one of the most popular trade we are analyzing in 
                    this project.
                    <ul>
                        The main idea, first of all,  is to explain what weather futures are and how they related to the weather, particularly to the temperature.
                        The second step for the project is to implement one of the existing algorithms for weather prediction and, based on that, to implement calculations for the prices for the chosen month.
